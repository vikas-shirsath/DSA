Pigeon Hole Principle :
	if you put more than n objects into n containers, then at least one container must hold more than one object.

if k > n objects are placed into n boxes, then at least one box contains at least [k/n] objects.

example:
	if you have 13 socks and 12 drawers, at least one drawer must have 2 or more socks.

example : 
	if k objects are placed into n containers, then at least one container has at least [k/n] objects.

k = 100, n = 9

Pigeon Hole Sort : 
arr = {3, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 3, 6, 3, 4, 5}
min = 1
max = 6

int newArray[] = new int[max-min+1]

0 1 2 3 4 5 index
2 2 3 2 1 1 elements (frequency)

1 1 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 5 6
