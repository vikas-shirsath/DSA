// TurnIt

// Chef is playing Need For Speed. Currently, his car is running on a straight road with a velocity U metres per second and approaching a 90 âˆ˜  turn which is S metres away from him. To successfully cross the turn, velocity of the car when entering the turn must not exceed V metres per second.

// The brakes of Chef's car allow him to slow down with a deceleration (negative acceleration) not exceeding A metres per squared second. Tell him whether he can cross the turn successfully.
